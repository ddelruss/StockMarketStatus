The StockMarketStatus utility class runs local logic to determine if the US stock market is open.

Logic is based on hard-coded hours and holidays, currently updated through 2013. New holidays are
easy enough to add in the .m file. In general I am not a fan of hardcoding hours and such, but I 
needed this functionality for my stock trading app.

Please feel free to take and adapt in any way you like - it is OK to ignore the comments in the .h and .m - 
no copyright is intended or will ever be persued.

Enjoy,

Damien
